# Frostmark

Frostmark is a simple bookmarks manager. It can import all bookmarks from
multiple browsers, list the imported bookmarks and export them via HTML format.

The goal for the future is to be able to extensively manage the bookmarks both
via console and GUI interface, automatically search the system for the
available browsers, import the profiles without explicitly specifying paths
to the browser profiles and export all or only specific folders even directly
into the browser's bookmarks.

Feel free to open a pull request with your improvements for the project, open
an issue in case of bug or a feature request and come and talk about the
project in the
[Matrix community](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+frostmark:matrix.org)
